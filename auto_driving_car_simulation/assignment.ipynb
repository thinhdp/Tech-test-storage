    "# Auto Driving Car Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with developing a simulation program for an autonomous driving car, with the aim of competing with Tesla. Your team has already developed a prototype car, but it is still in its primitive stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation program is designed to work with a rectangular field, specified by its width and height. The bottom left coordinate of the field is at position (0,0), and the top right position is denoted (width,height). For example, a field with dimensions 10 x 10 would have its upper right coordinate at position (9,9).\n",
    "\n",
    "One or more cars can be added to the field, each with a unique name, starting position, and direction they are facing. For instance, a car named \"A\" may be placed at position (1,2) and facing North.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of commands can be issued to each car, which can be one of three commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "- L: rotates the car by 90 degrees to the left\n",
    "- R: rotates the car by 90 degrees to the right\n",
    "- F: moves forward by 1 grid point\n",
    "\n",
    "If a car tries to move beyond the boundary of the field, the command is ignored, and the car stays in its current position. For example, if a car at position (0,0) is facing South and receives an F command, the command will be ignored as it would take the car beyond the boundary of the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can interact with your simulation program through the command line interface. Upon launching the program, users are prompted with the following message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Welcome to Auto Driving Car Simulation!\n",
    "\n",
    "Please enter the width and height of the simulation field in x y format:\n",

    "## Scenario 1 - Running simulation with a single car\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, there are a field, a car with initial position, facing, and commands available. If user attempts to run simulation, user can enter:\n",
    "\n",

    "## General Guidelines\n",
    "1. The solution should be production grade with tests , guideline on how to run code etc and following standard software engineering guidelines\n",
    "2. If any assumptions are made, please document and share those as part of the submission.\n",
    "3. Similarly, if you identify any gaps or areas of improvements, please identify them as well. \n"
